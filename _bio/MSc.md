My studies in Astronomy started in 2015, when I joined the M.Sc. in Astronomy program of the University of Sussex, 
United Kingdom.

During my postgraduate studies, the Stellar and Galactic Astrophysics and the Astrophysical Processes 
courses gave me the opportunity to interpret the equations of stellar structure and dynamics, and to 
understand the phenomena occurring in the interstellar and intergalactic media. Furthermore, the Cosmology 
and the Extragalactic Astronomy modules strengthened my understanding of the equations describing the 
expansion of the Universe, and the processes that govern the formation and evolution of galaxies along 
with their interactions with the intergalactic medium.

My MSc project gave me the ability to study galaxies produced by the L-Galaxies SAM, and explore the dependence of
their size and angular momentum on morphological and environmental parameters. I examined the phenomena occurring
inside groups and clusters and their impact on the aforementioned physical properties. In addition, I had the chance to
perform a few adjustments to the code in order to track the secular and violent evolution of bulges and investigate
their behaviour independently.
