My studies in Physics started in 2009, when I was admitted through national examinations to my first selection, 
the Physics Department of the University of Ioannina, Greece.

As an undergraduate student, my interest in astronomy began with my participation in elective courses on Cosmology and 
Astrophysics. Being interested in obtaining a deeper insight in physical and observational cosmology, I took courses
on Observational Astrophysics and Physics of Galaxies and the Planetary System. These courses gave me the
opportunity to study the structure and morphology of the Universe and strengthened my background. In addition, the
Cosmology course further shaped my interest in cosmological models, dark matter and dark energy.
