In 2017, I started my Ph.D. in Astronomy, which I obtained in 2021, at the University of Sussex, where I also worked
as a doctoral tutor. My scientific supervisors were Prof. Peter Thomas and Dr. Mark Sargent. 

My research focussed on the dynamics of simulated galaxies and their components, mainly their discs, 
bulges, and bars. I have developed and worked with semi-analytic models (L-Galaxies model) and cosmological and zoom-in 
simulations (the EAGLE and FLARES simulations). I also collaborated with the Auriga team at MPA, Garching 
where we studied the effect of AGN feedback on bar, bulge, and disc dynamics in the Milky-Way analogue galaxies of the
Auriga simulation.
